Nokia Screen - A library written in NodeJS for controlling Nokia 3310 Screens on a Raspberry Pi--I could only find libraries for the Nokia 3310 Screen written in Python, I found one library in NodeJS but it was very broken and decided to use C rather than depends such as the SPI and GPIO libraries available.This code is UNTESTED.Yes thats right, I've practically ported a library and not tested this code with a Nokia 3310 screen (Mines refusing to work full stop :(! )If you have a Nokia 3310 Screen please test and contribute any fixes to it.I've done my best to have it replicate the Library I ported:https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Nokia_LCDWhen I'm able to test the library myself I'll be able to work on it and ensure its up to snuff.I'll probably employ the use of Jimp to generate images to display on the screen or something like that.I'd like to create a full smart device with it, maybe with a RPi Zero.Maybe emulate a Nokia 3310's functionality!Anyway, check the example.js file for getting started.Hook your screens Reset and D/C pins to somewhere on your RPi, add them to example.js on line 8 `let screen = new NokiaScreen(DC, RESET, spi);`Then hook the rest of the screen up to SPI where needed.There's no support for controlling the backlight currently.Thats planned when this library is actually tested and working..
